# PDF Summarization App

This application allows users to extract and summarize text from PDF documents. It uses the Gemini LLM to extract and summarize data from pdfs while making use of Django to provide a user-interface.

## Features:
- Upload PDF files for summarization
- Extracts and summarizes text automatically
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction

## Installation:
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zanielsen162/pdf-summarization-app.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have dependencies installed.
3. Enter the `core` folder
4. Run `python manage.py runserver`

## Upcoming
I will be implementing an user history feature.
